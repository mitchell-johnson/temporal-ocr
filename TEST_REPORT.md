# Workflow Test Report

## Overview
This report documents the testing of the OCR workflow system. The system uses Temporal for workflow orchestration and includes activities for document processing using Azure Document Intelligence, Azure OpenAI, and Google Gemini.

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers the following areas:

1. **Document Intelligence Activities**
   - Initialization and configuration
   - Document processing functionality
   - Error handling for missing files
   - Error handling for missing environment variables

2. **Workflow Runner**
   - Starting workflows with different configurations
   - Error handling in workflow execution

## Test Results

All tests in the following areas are passing:

```
tests/activities/test_document_intelligence_activities.py::test_document_intelligence_init PASSED
tests/activities/test_document_intelligence_activities.py::test_process_document PASSED
tests/activities/test_document_intelligence_activities.py::test_process_document_file_not_found PASSED
tests/activities/test_document_intelligence_activities.py::test_missing_environment_variables PASSED
tests/workflows/test_workflow_runner.py::test_start_document_workflow PASSED
tests/workflows/test_workflow_runner.py::test_start_document_workflow_error_handling PASSED
```

## Code Changes Made to Improve Testability

1. **Workflow Runner**
   - Modified `start_document_workflow` to accept an optional client parameter for testing
   - Simplified the data converter approach

2. **Workflow Implementation**
   - Added helper methods to make activity execution more testable
   - Refactored for better error handling and logging

## Future Test Improvements

1. **Workflow Integration Tests**
   - Create more sophisticated tests for the complete workflow execution
   - Add tests with realistic document samples

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Add tests for concurrent execution of workflows
   - Measure and optimize execution times

3. **Additional Activities Testing**
   - Add comprehensive tests for the Gemini activities
   - Add comprehensive tests for the Azure OpenAI activities

## Running the Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
python tests/run_tests.py
```

Run specific test modules:
```bash
python tests/run_tests.py tests/activities
python tests/run_tests.py tests/workflows/test_workflow_runner.py
```

## Test Environment Setup

The test environment includes the following:

1. **Mocked External Services**
   - Azure Document Intelligence
   - Azure OpenAI
   - Google Gemini API

2. **Local Temporal Server**
   - Used for workflow testing

3. **Test Data**
   - Sample PDF files generated during test execution
